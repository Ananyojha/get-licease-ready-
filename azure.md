  # WINDOWS SERVER ON AZURE - Pricing Cal to show 2 use cases - permamnet and temp
  Here's a script for a trainer, ensuring that no information is missed:

**Trainer Script: Licensing Windows Server in Azure**

**Introduction:**
- "Hello and welcome to this session on Licensing Windows Server in Azure."
- "My name is Louise Ulrich, and I'm delighted to guide you through this presentation."
- "These slides support the module with the same name in the certifications available at getlicensingready.com."
- "For reference materials, you can find handouts on the same site."

**Licensing Scenario - Wide World Importers:**
- "Let's start with a licensing scenario involving a company called Wide World Importers."
- "They have an existing on-premises server farm with fully licensed Windows Server virtual machines."
- "Now, they are considering running Windows Server virtual machines in Azure as a proof of concept project."

**Azure Pricing Calculator:**
- "To understand the pricing, we'll use the Azure Pricing Calculator, which is a useful tool for estimating Azure service costs."
- "We've selected parameters such as region, operating system, virtual machine type, and payment option."

**Pay-as-You-Go Pricing:**
- "Wide World Importers opted for the pay-as-you-go payment option, with an estimated monthly cost of $145."
- "This means they will be charged only for the actual time their virtual machines are running."

**Humongous Insurance:**
- "Now, let's consider another example with Humongous Insurance, who are ready to commit to Azure."
- "They are interested in better pricing as they plan to run their virtual machines full-time."

**Reserved Instances and Azure Hybrid Benefit:**
- "To achieve better pricing, customers can use Reserved Instances and the Azure Hybrid Benefit."
- "Reserved Instances provide cost savings for the base compute part of Azure virtual machines."

**Reserved Instance Choices:**
- "Customers must choose a specific term (1 or 3 years), virtual machine type, Azure data center, and availability scope."
- "These choices can be adjusted later for flexibility."

**Reserved Instance Flexibility:**
- "Reserved Instances offer flexibility."
- "Customers can reassign, exchange, or cancel their reserved instances to adapt to changing needs."

**Azure Hybrid Benefit:**
- "The Azure Hybrid Benefit allows customers to use their Windows Server licenses either on-premises or in Azure."
- "Eligible customers can choose how to utilize these licenses."

**Eligibility for Azure Hybrid Benefit:**
- "Customers with Windows Server core licenses and Software Assurance through volume licensing agreements are eligible."
- "Service subscriptions are also available for Windows Server Standard core licenses."

**Rules for Windows Server Standard:**
- "Windows Server Standard can be used on-premises or in Azure, and licenses can be assigned to both during migration."

**Rules for Windows Server Data Center:**
- "Windows Server Data Center licenses can be used on-premises with unlimited virtualization rights."
- "This option is available only through volume licensing agreements."

**Licensing Windows Server in Azure:**
- "Now, let's discuss how to license Windows Server in Azure."

**Licensing Windows Server Standard:**
- "For Windows Server Standard, an all-inclusive meter covers both compute and Windows Server costs."

**Licensing Windows Server Data Center:**
- "Windows Server Data Center licenses provide unlimited virtualization rights and are suitable for on-premises use."

**Reserved Instances and Azure Hybrid Benefit in Action:**
- "We've seen how Reserved Instances cover compute costs, and the Azure Hybrid Benefit is used for Windows Server licensing."

**Automatic Assignment with Reserved Instances:**
- "Reserved Instances are automatically matched with running virtual machines, simplifying cost management."

**Virtual Machine Families:**
- "Azure matches reserved instance units within virtual machine families for flexibility."

**Azure Hybrid Benefit Activation:**
- "To activate the Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server, it must be manually selected when creating or updating a virtual machine."

**Conclusion:**
- "I hope you've found this session on Licensing Windows Server in Azure informative."
- "You can download the handout supporting this presentation and take the associated exam on the getlicensingready.com site."
- "Depending on your interests and needs, explore other modules and certifications available on the same site."
- "Wishing you the very best of luck with your exam!"
